# Enhancing Classifier Conservativeness and Robustness by Polynomiality

This repo contains code we used for the paper Enhancing Classifier Conservativeness and Robustness by Polynomiality, CVPR, 2022

The novel SoftRmax function is implemented in the module 'marco_softmax' in the file cifar/network.py. Feel free to take it and plug it somewhere else :).

Cheers!
