# Enhancing Classifier Conservativeness and Robustness by Polynomiality

This repo contains code we used for the paper Enhancing Classifier Conservativeness and Robustness by Polynomiality, CVPR, 2022

The code is very simple. What matters is the module 'marco_softmax' in the file cifar/network.py, which is the implementation of softRmax. Feel free to take it and plug it somewhere else :).

Cheers!
